			Chapter 3 of the textbook is an academic study of the issues
			involved in implementing any raster graphics package; it is
			not a description of the actual internal workings of any
			particular SRGP implementation. SRGP has been implemented on
			several major types of hardware platforms, and in all cases,
			low-level graphics utilities (QuickDraw on the Mac, X11 on
			workstations, and MetaGraphics on the PC) were used. Because
			the authors of SRGP were not involved in the implementation
			of the software actually drawing the primitives, there is no
			pixel-level compatibility between SRGP applications running
			on different platforms. Fortunately, the inconsistency in
			appearance will be typically noticeable only for extreme
			values for attributes (very thick primitives, rare
			combinations of write mode and pen/fill style, etc.).
		</p><p>
			The textbook spec did not discuss how SRGP would work in a
			windowing environment. This document describes how the
			windowing environment affects SRGP, and introduces a few new
			routines addressing window-specific problems.
		</p><p>
			The textbook's description of locator echo included "no
			echo" as an option available to the application. However, it
			was determined that an invisible cursor is frustrating to
			users of a multi-window system. The "no echo" option is thus
			honored only by the PC version of SRGP.
		</p><p>
			The textbook (page 33) claims that the colors black and
			white are 1 and 0, respectively, at all times. This is true
			for all devices having color tables, but it is sometimes
			false for monochrome systems that are designed for
			white-on-black display.
		</p><p>
			The textbook did not describe methods for loading bitmap and
			pixmap patterns into the respective pattern tables, for
			loading fonts into the font table, and for loading entries
			in the color table. See sections 3.1 and 3.3 of this
			document.
		</p><p>
			There are now "deluxe" versions of the measure records for
			each input device. These should be used when timestamps and
			modifer-key chords are needed.
		</p><p>
			The textbook specifies the size of the screen canvas cannot
			be changed by the application. That is no longer the case.
		</p></div><div class="chapter" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N65577"></a>Chapter&nbsp;2.&nbsp;States of the System</h2></div></div><div></div></div><p>
			SRGP must be enabled before use, and disabled after use.
		</p><pre class="programlisting">
			void SRGP_begin (char *name, int width, int height, int
			planes, boolean enable_trace);
		</pre><p>
			The window which will represent canvas #0 (the SRGP
			screen-canvas) is created; its initial size is determined by
			the values of the second and third parameters. The first
			parameter specifies a name for the application. The fifth
			parameter specifies the initial status of the tracing
			feature, which is described later in this section.
		</p><p>
			The fourth parameter is meaningful only on a display
			supporting color. It specifies how many planes of the color
			table should be reserved for SRGP's use; i.e., it places an
			upper bound on the number of colors that may be displayed
			simultaneously in the SRGP window. (The upper bound is 2p
			colors, where p is the number of planes.) The fourth
			parameter is ignored when the program is run on a bilevel
			display.
		</p><p>
			If the program is being run on a color display, and you send
			the special value "0" as the fourth parameter, SRGP will
			take over the entire color table, giving your application
			color support as rich as the hardware can offer. (After
			initializing SRGP, you can inquire the "canvas depth" to
			determine how many planes are available.) The disadvantage:
			it will be impossible for the user to simultaneously see the
			SRGP window's proper coloring and the other clients'
			windows' proper coloring. Thus, you should request "0"
			planes only when your application truly needs full control
			of the color table
		</p><p>
			If you request more planes than available, all available
			planes are allocated, just as if you requested "0" planes.
			Inquiry is thus your only way of determining exactly how
			many planes are available.
		</p><pre class="programlisting">
			void SRGP_tracing (boolean);
		</pre><p>
			When tracing is enabled, a message is sent to a logging file
			('SRGPlogfile' in the current directory) each time the
			application calls an SRGP function; the message includes
			echoing of key parameters. IMPORTANT: Calls to some of the
			input functions are NOT traced; see section 5 for details.
			See section 7 for more information on execution with
			tracing.
		</p><p>
			The initial status of tracing is set when the application
			calls SRGP begin, but it may be changed at any time via a
			call to SRGP tracing.
		</p><pre class="programlisting">
			void SRGP_allowResize (boolean);
		</pre><p>
			By default, the screen-canvas window cannot be resized by
			the user. It is advisable that applications live with this
			restriction. The rare application that needs to allow
			resizing can use this routine. It is important to note that
			various artifacts occur when the user actually does take
			advantage of this freedom and perform a resize:
		</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
					The window is cleared to color 0; any information
					that was on the screen just before the resize is
					lost.
				</p></li><li><p>
					The clip rectangle attribute is not changed
					automatically; the application must be responsible
					for changing it ifnecessary.
				</p></li></ol></div><p>
			Obviously, an application that allows resizing must be
			informed whenever a resize occurs, to cope with the
			aforementioned problems and other application-specific ones.
			SRGP provides a callback utility, which allows an
			application to provide a function to be called whenever a
			resize has occurred:
		</p><pre class="programlisting">
			typedef int (*funcptr)(); void SRGP_registerResizeCallback
			(funcptr);
		</pre><p>
			The application-provided callback function referred to by
			the function-pointer parameter will be called whenever a
			resize has occurred. The callback function will receive two
			integers: the new width and the new height.
		</p><pre class="programlisting">
			void SRGP_changeScreenCanvasSize (int newwidth, int
			newheight);
		</pre><p>
			This routine allows the application to modify the size of
			the screen canvas. As a side-effect, the resize-callback
			function (if any) is called, just as if the user had
			requested the resize.
		</p><pre class="programlisting">
			void SRGP_enableSynchronous (void);
		</pre><p>
			Allows you to enable X's synchronous mode, a useful mode for
			debugging. The mode is discussed rigorously in section 3,
			and again in section 7.
		</p><pre class="programlisting">void SRGP_end (void);</pre><p>
			The screen-canvas window is deleted, and the logging file is
			closed.
